üïí Introduction:
This PowerShell script automates the task of launching an application at a specified time. Whether you want to start your favorite game, productivity tool, or any other application, this script will do it for you!

üöÄ Instructions:
1. Open a text editor (like Notepad) on your computer.
2. Copy and paste the script below into the text editor.

‚öôÔ∏è Script:
```powershell
# Set the time to launch the application (24-hour format)
$LaunchTime = "15:30"

# Specify the path to the application executable
$ApplicationPath = "C:\Path\To\Your\Application.exe"

# Infinite loop to check the current time and launch the application at the specified time
while ($true) {
    $CurrentTime = Get-Date -Format HH:mm
    if ($CurrentTime -eq $LaunchTime) {
        Start-Process -FilePath $ApplicationPath
        break
    }
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 60  # Check every minute
}
```

3. Replace `"15:30"` with the desired launch time in 24-hour format (e.g., `"09:00"` for 9:00 AM).
4. Replace `"C:\Path\To\Your\Application.exe"` with the path to the application executable you want to launch.
5. Save the file with a `.ps1` extension (e.g., `LaunchApp.ps1`) on your computer.

üîß Execution:
1. Open PowerShell on your computer.
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved the script using the `cd` command.
3. Run the script by typing its name (e.g., `.\LaunchApp.ps1`) and pressing Enter.

üéâ Congratulations! Your application will now launch automatically at the specified time. Sit back and enjoy the automation!
